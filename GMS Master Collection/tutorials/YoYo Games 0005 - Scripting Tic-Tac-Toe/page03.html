<h2>Create the Objects</h2>

We will now setup the room and the objects we need to control the game.
<br>
<br>

To setup the room, select <b>Resources</b> and <b>Create Room</b>. We will be using a width of 640 and height of 480.
Select the backgrounds option in the Room Properties window and select the background image we created earlier.	
<br>
<br>

The first object we will create is an object whose responsibility it is
to represent the grid the game is played on and handle the player's interactions with the grid.
Select <b>Resources</b> and <b>Create Object</b>. Rename the new object to <i>objGameBoard</i> and select
it.
<br>
<br>

Next, add a <i>Create</i> event for the object and add an <i>Action</i> that performs the <i>Execute a piece of code</i>
action. Edit the code and simply add the following piece of script: <i>scrGameInit()</i>. We will implement the script this
code calls later on.
<br>
<br>

For the purposes of this tutorial we will keep the code that is executed by the actions added to each object down to the bare minimum and will 
simply call through to the relevant script that is added later on. This maintains a certain level of cleanliness to the project by ensuring
that all script code is found in a simple, consistent location.
<br>
<br>

The other events we need to add for this object are:
<br>
<br>

<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td><b>Event</b></td>
		<td><b>Script Called</b></td>	        
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Step</td>
		<td>scrGameUpdate()</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Global Mouse Left Pressed</td>
		<td>scrMousePressed()</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Draw</td>
		<td>scrGameBoardDraw()</td>
	</tr>
</table>	

Before proceeding further, return to the room we previously created and add an instance of this object to the room - any 
location in the room will do. This is the only object we need to add to the room and thus concludes the setup necessary for the room.
<br>
<br>

We need to create a further three objects: 
<ul>
	<li><b>objBoardCell </b>: represents the contents of a cell on the board
	<li><b>objBoardLayout </b>: represents the location in the room of the board and the size of the grid cells
	<li><b>objGameDifficulty </b>: represents the object used to select the difficulty setting for the AI
</ul>

Note that the object for the board layout, <i>objBoardLayout</i>, may seem extraneous, but it is used to separate out how the display of the grid is presented from
the logic of the board thus providing a single, clean location where we can modify the layout of the game according to our assets.
It is notionally present as an introduction to the idea of the <i>single responsibility</i> principle of software engineering and an introduction
as to how we can use an object to essentially encapsulate what is otherwise global data.
<br>
<br>

Note also that the object objGameDifficulty has the sprite <i>sprDifficulty</i> attached to it although its rendering we will handle via script for
the sake of consistency.
<br>
<br>

The event/script pairs for the additional 3 objects are as follows:
<br>
<br>

<b>objBoardCell:</b>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td><b>Event</b></td>
		<td><b>Script Called</b></td>	        
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Create</td>
		<td>scrBoardCellInit()</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Draw</td>
		<td>scrBoardCellDraw()</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<b>objBoardLayout:</b>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td><b>Event</b></td>
		<td><b>Script Called</b></td>	        
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Create</td>
		<td>scrBoardLayoutInit()</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<b>objGameDifficulty:</b>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td><b>Event</b></td>
		<td><b>Script Called</b></td>	        
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Create</td>
		<td>scrGameDifficultyInit()</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Draw</td>
		<td>scrDifficultyDraw()</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Left Pressed</td>
		<td>scrDifficultySelected()</td>
	</tr>
</table>
