<h2>Tic - Tac - Toe</h2>

Welcome to <i>GameMaker</i>. This tutorial will demonstrate the use of <i>GameMaker's</i> scripting language
to create a <i>Tic-Tac-Toe</i> (sometimes known as <i>Noughts-and-Crosses</i>) game. It is expected that you 
already have a basic understanding of how <i>GameMaker</i> works.
	
Whilst it's unlikely you will not know how to play <i>Tic-Tac-Toe</i> it's worth re-iterating how

<i>Tic-Tac-Toe</i> is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take it in turns to place their piece onto an 
empty cell on the grid. If a player creates a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of three of 
their pieces he wins the game. If the grid is completely filled and no rows of three pieces exist the game
is over and it ends in a draw.

In this tutorial the first player to place their piece will be the human player and the computer will
place second. The human player uses the mouse to select the cell they wish to place their piece in.
The final game will look as follows:

The game will use some special resources created for this purpose. To find them on your computer, please go to the top of the <i>GameMaker</i> screen and select the <b>Help</b> 
drop-down menu. You will see an option marked <b>Open Project</b> in explorer. If you select that then the standard file explorer will open showing the contents of you 
<i>GameMaker</i> project directory, and there you can browse to "Assets" all resources are stored here.
