<h2>Isometric Games</h2>

Welcome to <i>GameMaker</i>. This tutorial will demonstrate how to use <i>GameMaker</i> to build
a simple Isometric game. To follow this tutorial you will need to have a basic understanding of how <i>GameMaker</i>
works and preferrably will already have an understanding of how <i>GameMaker's</i> scripting language works.
<br>
<br>

Isometric games have been around for a long time (early examples of isometric games include Q*bert and Zaxxon, both released in 1982). 
They are particularly popular for resource management games where the pseudo-3D look and feel of such games provides a more immersive experience
than simply presenting the level in a purely 2D manner whilst retaining the technological simplicity of a sprite based game. Such games have
experienced a resurgence in recent years due to the increasing popularity of internet browser based games.

The end result of the tutorial should look like this:

The game will use some special resources created for this purpose. To find them on your computer, please go to the top of the <i>GameMaker</i> screen and select the <b>Help</b> 
drop-down menu. You will see an option marked <b>Open Project</b> in explorer. If you select that then the standard file explorer will open showing the contents of you 
<i>GameMaker</i> project directory, and there you can browse to "Assets" and all resources are stored here. In the process of this tutorial you may  
be reminded of this location.
