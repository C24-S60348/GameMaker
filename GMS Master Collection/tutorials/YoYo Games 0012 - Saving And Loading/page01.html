<h2>Saving And Loading</h2>

At some point while creating your game you will find that you need to save data for later use. This can simply be because you want to store some simple options that the player has chosen, like music on/off 
or a difficulty setting, or it may be that you want to save the current game state for the player to re-start again later. This tutorial aims to show you how to achieve these things using the different file 
functions available in GML.

Before going any further, please note that this tutorial is designed to be used on the <b>Windows</b> target module as certain parts require keyboard input, but the functions and techniques shown are perfectly 
valid for all other platforms and can be used on all of them with minimal modification.
<br>
<br>

Also note that the included game file that has loaded with this tutorial has all the objects, graphics and sounds etc... already created and programmed for you, as we only want to concentrate on the actual 
saving and loading functions themselves which you are going to add in as we go. This means that the tutorial requires a good working knowledge of the <b>GameMaker Language (GML)</b> to get the most out of it, 
but if you are are new to GML you can also use it to learn a lot about basic functions since all code in the examples is fully commented and explained.
<br>
<br>

Before going any further, why not run the game now and see how it works? It should run fine, only all the things that are there which you would like to save (music on or off, your name etc...) will not be. But you will 
soon fix that, won't you?
