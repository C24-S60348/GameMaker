<h2>Text Files</h2>

When dealing with large amounts of data, or data formats that do not easily fall into a key/value pair, you need to save them using <b>text files</b>. Text files are slightly more complex to use than ini files 
but they are far more flexible and permit rapid saving and loading of large data chunks.
<br>
<br>

Now, there are MANY ways to save and load data using text files, and it would be impossible to show you <i>all</i> possible ways, so for this particular tutorial we are going for one of the simplest (and most 
inefficient!) methods as it is a good base to start from and also permits you to learn by trying to improve it yourself at a later date.
<br>
<br>

Before we start working with text files, there are a few things that you should know about them...
<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>First of all, you should know that you can open them for <i>reading</i>, <i>writing</i> or <i>appending</i>. Reading means exactly what it says, you are opening the file only to read information from 
it, but there is a big difference between appending and writing a file though. When you write to a file, you <i><b>wipe the file of all information</b></i> and then write to the empty file from the start, while when 
you append a file, you are adding information to that already contained in the file, and must therefore skip to the position within the file that you wish to start writing at first before actually writing.
<br>
<br>

<li>Another thing that should be noted is that text files require that you control everything that is written to them, <i>including</i> line breaks. So if you have three lines of text to write to a file, just calling the write 
function three times will actually write them all to the same line in a consecutive order! So, what you will have to do is write a line to a file, then write a new line using the appropriate function, then the next line, 
then a new line etc...
<br>
<br>

<li>Finally, you should be aware that you can open multiple text files at once, and so you need to store the <b>file id</b> of every single text file that you open, and then use that id for all the function calls so 
that <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> knows which file it should be working with. Failing to do this will cause errors in your games.
<br>
<br>
</ul>

With that introduction to text files out of the way, let's see if we can't make a basic system for saving levels in a game that uses them.
