<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Your game must be added into Game Center and be enabled before any of the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> functions can be used, however it is worth noting that 
after adding an app to iTunes Connect, you <i>must submit it for review within 90 days</i>. So it is a good idea to have your game finished (or close to finished) 
before integrating it with the Game Center as you are effectively committing to a ship date when you add the app.
<br>
<br>

Assuming that this is all fine and well, the next thing you need to do is add your game to the Game Center, and this is done by clicking on the "<b>Add New App</b>" 
button at the top left of the screen.

If you have contracts in effect for both iOS and Mac OS X apps, you will be asked to select your app type (If you have only signed a contract for one app type, you will not see this page) and 
after making your selection the iTunes Connect web application will prompt you for a variety of information about your app, including the app’s name, screenshots, pricing, SKU number, and bundle identifier. 
Once these details have been filled in (see the <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/docs/iTunesConnect_DeveloperGuide.pdf" target="_blank">iTunes Connect Developers Guide</a> for a precise 
explanation of this process) you can then go ahead and set up the Game Center by clicking on the button "<b>Manage Game Center</b>" found on the right of the game page.

You will be prompted to enable your game, so click the "<b>Enable</b>" button to continue.
