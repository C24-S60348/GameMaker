<h2>Game Center Integration</h2>

This tutorial aims to give a basic overview of how to integrate your iOS game with the Apple Game Center. It is split into two parts, with the first half showing you an outline of how 
to set up the Game Center with a simple leaderboard and then add some achievements, and the second half of the tutorial explains how to have your game send information to the Game Center 
to update them.

However, before you can get started it should be noted that to use this functionality you <b>must</b> be an Apple registered developer with a Dev Account at 
<a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa" target="_blank">iTunes Connect</a>. If you meet these requirements, you should now 
log in to your account and go to the section <b>"Manage Your Applications"</b> as that is where we are going to start.
