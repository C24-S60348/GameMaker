<h2>Logging Out and Summary</h2>

The final function that you have in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> is <tt>achievement_logout</tt>.
<br>
<br>

With this function you will log out of the Game Center and none of the achievements or scores will be posted from that moment onwards. This does <i>not</i> mean that they 
are no longer recorded, however. They stored on the device by <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and will be retrieved and sent to the Game Center the very next time that the login 
function is completed.
<br>
<br>

It should be noted that this function is very rarely necessary and is only provided for those that think they may have need of it.
<br>
<br>

As you can see from the previous pages, using <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to connect with the Game Center is a very simple business. However, you really should take time to get 
to know the Apple side of things before even starting to experiment with achievements and the like as they are very particular about how things are done. It is <i>strongly</i> 
recommended that you read all the available documentation provided by Apple before attempting to integrate any game into their system to avoid errors and confusion. Further information 
can be found logging into your <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa" target="_blank">iTunes Connect</a> account or by reading the 
<a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/docs/iTunesConnect_DeveloperGuide.pdf" target="_blank">iTunes Connect Developers Guide</a>.
