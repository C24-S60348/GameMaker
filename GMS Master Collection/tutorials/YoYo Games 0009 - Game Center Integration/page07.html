<h2>Sending A High Score</h2>

As with achievements, <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> makes it incredibly easy to add your players scores to the leaderboard for your game.
<br>
<br>

You will need to know the name of the leaderboard that you wish to post the score too (this is the <b>Leaderboard ID</b> as mentioned on page 3 of this tutorial) and it is sent along with the 
score using the function <tt>achievement_post_score</tt>. the actual code would look something like this:
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="ScorePost.png">
<br>

Don't forget that you can have various leaderboards for each game, so if your game has three different worlds you can have three single leaderboards (one for each world) and then a compiled 
leaderboard of the all three together.
<br>
<br>

It is also a good idea to keep track of the players high scores on a local level, creating ini files to store them, so that they can track their progress on an individual level as well as on Game Center 
against the other people that may have been playing your game too.
