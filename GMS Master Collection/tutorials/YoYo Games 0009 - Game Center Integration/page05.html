<h2>GameMaker Support</h2>

Setting up <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to work with the Game Center couldn't be easier. First you need to log into the Game Center using the following code:
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="Login.png">
<br>

This should be done right at the start of your game, as, if not, none of the leaderboards or achievements will be updated.
<br>
<br>

However, it should be noted, that even if you do not do this immediately, or if the connection fails or is unavailable, the scores and achievements that the player gets 
while playing your game will be stored on the device. Then, the next time your device manages to log into the Game center, <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will send this 
information automatically, meaning that your player achievements and scores will always be kept up to date when possible.
