<h2>Scaling On Devices</h2>

Hopefully you have read through the rest of this tutorial and are now familiar with the ideas presented, ie: room scaling, view scaling and the importance of <i>aspect ratio</i> (if you have skipped everything to 
get to this page, it is <i>strongly</i> suggested that you go back and start from the beginning!). These core concepts are essential to correct scaling on devices, whether it be Windows Phone, Android or iOS.
<br>
<br>

However, there is one other important thing that you should be aware of when designing for mobile, and that is the <b>dpi</b> of the display ("dpi" is the "dots per inch" of the display, also sometimes know and 
the "ppi", "pixels per inch"). This really can complicate matters quite a lot and the actual solution that you come up with will depend entirely on your game and the target platform. Therefore this tutorial will cover the 
core concepts and suggest ways to resolve the problems associated with variable dpi and resolution.
<br>
<br>

Before starting, let's just be clear on two things:
<br>
<br>

<ul>
	<li>Resolution: The number of pixels that make up the screen width and height, no matter the <i>physical</i> width and height, eg: 1024 x 768<br><br>
	<li>Dpi: The number of actual pixels that can be found in a single square inch of the screen, independant of the resolution.
</ul>

So,for example,  if we have an iPhone 5 with a resolution of 1136x640, it will have a a dpi of 326 (its screen is relatively small so to show this resolution you need to cram many pixels into one inch), however if 
you take a Windows 8 tablet (for example) it has a very similar resolution of 1366x768, yet it's dpi is 148! That's more than half the dpi of the iPhone 5. What does this mean for the developer? Well, unfortunately 
it means that what may look great on your tablet may look terrible on the iPhone due to the difference - with buttons and text being practically illegible because of it - or vice versa.
<br>
<br>

What can you do about this? Well, there are a number of things, like having two (or even three!) sets of game assets that you use, and switch between them depending on a dpi check of the device 
(<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> has special functions for this), but that's not generally what you would want to do. Instead you can go with the simpler option of using the <b>Draw GUI Event</b> (a sub event of 
the <b>Draw Event</b>) and scale <i>that</i> to suit the device so that everything is drawn as you would expect. This is what we are going to cover in the next page of this tutorial.
<br>
<br>

Note that the <b>Draw GUI Event</b> is great for HUDs, text and buttons, but it is <i>not</i> designed to be used for the game itself.
