<h2>Summary</h2>

No matter what games you make with <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>, you will at some point come across the problem of scaling the game to fit different display sizes and resolutions, which is why it's important to 
understand things like aspect ratio and how it can be used to scale things correctly. Hopefully this tutorial will have helped clear up the core concepts and give you a series of scripts that you can use and adapt to 
your needs.
<br>
<br>

Please note that this tutorial is <i>not</i> by any means the definitive guide, as that would be virtually impossible given the sheer number of different ways this can be done. However it should provide you with 
the  necessary tools and knowledge for you to be able to make sure that any game you create in the future is adaptable enough to be ported onto any of the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> platforms with the 
minimum of fuss.
<br>
<br>

The most important thing to realise is that no matter what your game is like, there is a method of scaling the image to fit the display of the target platform that will work for you, and as long as you keep the 
aspect ratio of the view correct, then the visible area that is drawn on the display should scale correctly.
