<h2>Scrolling Shooter</h2>

Scrolling shooters are a very popular type of arcade action game, and are also rather easy to create with a package like <i>GameMaker</i>. In this tutorial we will make such a 
game and, in the process, you learn a number of aspects of <i>GameMaker</i>, in particular the use of variables. In a scrolling shooter the player controls an object, for example 
a plane, spaceship, or car, which moves over a scrolling background. Obstacles appear on the background that must be avoided and enemies appear that must be shot. Often bonus 
objects appear that can be picked up for addition benefits. During the game the number, variety, and strength of the enemies increases making it harder and harder to survive.

<br>

In this tutorial we will create a scrolling shooter called <i>1945</i>, in which the player flies in a plane over a sea and enemy planes try to destroy the player. We will treat aspects 
like how to create the illusion of motion using a scrolling background, how to control the plane, how to make enemies and bullets, and how to deal with the score, with lives and with 
the damage of the plane. But first of all we delve into a very important aspect of <i>GameMaker</i> that extends the possibilities considerably: the use of <b>variables</b>.
<br>
<br>

The game will use some special resources created for this purpose. To find them on your computer, please go to the top of the <i>GameMaker</i> screen and select the <b>Help</b> 
drop-down menu. You will see an option marked <b>Open Project</b> in explorer. If you select that then the standard file explorer will open showing the contents of you 
<i>GameMaker</i> project directory, and there you can browse to "Assets" and all resources are stored here. In the process of this tutorial you will 
be reminded of this location.
