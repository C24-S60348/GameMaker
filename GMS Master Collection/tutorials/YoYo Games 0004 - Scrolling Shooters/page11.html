<h2>Finishing The Game</h2>

We have now created a scrolling shooter with different enemy planes. It has become a playable game that gets harder all the time. There actually is some fun in playing it and 
trying to achieve the highest score. But to turn it into a real game a couple of finishing touches are still required. We need some background music, a loading image, a better icon, etc.
<br>
<br>

I also put a delay in planes to reappear when shot, making it more interesting for the player to try and shoot planes, rather than simply avoid them. Finally there is a special fire 
bonus when the player reaches a score of 400 and another one when he reaches 1000 points.
<br>
<br>

You can use this game as a basis to extend further. Here are some ideas of what you could add. It is rather common in scrolling shooter games to find power-ups that give the player 
extra fire power, repair the damage, give extra points, give an extra plane, etc. Such power-ups can appear when the player shoots a plane or they might simply be encountered during 
the flying.
<br>
<br>

Also you could create extra types of enemy planes, for example, planes that fly from the side or fire more powerful missiles. I leave it to you to work on these and make your own scrolling 
shooter.

You can find a collection of 1945-related sprites, created by Ari Feldman, as a .bmp file in the Resources folder within this tutorial's folder. To get the individual sprites out of this file, 
create a sprite, click on the button <b>Edit Sprite</b>, select <b>Create from Strip</b> in the <b>File</b> menu, and select the image(s) you want. See the documentation for 
more information.
