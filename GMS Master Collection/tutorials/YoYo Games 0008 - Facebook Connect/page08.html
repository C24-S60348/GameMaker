<h2>Logging out</h2>

This final section is for logging out of Facebook.
<br>
<br>

Normally you would not want to have the user log out, but there may be moments where you wish the current user to log out of your game 
so that another user can log in (or some other reason) and so <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> gives you that option. for this, just create a new 
object and call it "obj_LogOut", give it a sprite and then add this code to the <b>left mouse button PRESSED event</b>:
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="logout_code.png"></img>

<br>
Simple, no? The user is now logged out of Facebook, so we set the <tt>global.Auth</tt>variable to false to prevent any of the buttons we have 
created previously from working. this may not be strictly necessary as some of them will just do nothing, and others will request that the user 
logs in again before functioning, but in general it is better to handle these situations yourself so that all users have the same experience and you 
can catch and prevent any possible errors.
<br>
<br>
Note that this does not in any way cancel the initialisation of the Facebook functions, it only removes the authorisation of the game to post to anyones 
wall. So, if you have a log in button you have no need to initialise Facebook once again as it will still be functioning.
