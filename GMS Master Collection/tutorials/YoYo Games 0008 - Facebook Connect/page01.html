<h2>Facebook Connect</h2>

This tutorial aims to explain the basic uses of some of the inlcuded <b>Facebook</b> functions for devices, which are:
<br>
<br>

<ul>
	<li>facebook_init()
	<li>facebook_status()
	<li>facebook_login()
	<li>facebook_dialog()
	<li>facebook_graph_request()
	<li>facebook_logout()
</ul>

Before starting this tutorial you <i>must</i> have a good working knowledge of GML (the GameMaker Language) and have created a "Test App" on Facebook, otherwise this 
tutorial will not work correctly. To do this you must log on to your Facebook account and go to the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook 
Developers</a> page and click on the "Apps" section at the top.
<br>
<br>

You should then proceed to create your test app, by clicking the button marked " + Create New App".
<br>

<br>
<br>
The actual app creation process on Facebook is out of the scope of this tutorial, so it is strongly recommended that before continuing you have read all 
the documentation from the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook Developers</a> and have a firm understanding of 
the facebook graphs, friends lists and wall functions. It is important that you also realise that the Facebook functions for <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> are 
also <i>asynchronous</i> and so the game will continue to run while waiting for user input on any Facebook dialogues or while waiting for a response 
from Facebook after any request has been sent. This means you should always plan ahead and never depend on any set response at any specific time 
when dealing with these functions.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Note for Android Apps</h2>

When you set up your Facebook page to accept an Android app, there are certain things that are important to note. The first thing is that the 
<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> Android Facebook functions currently do not support <b>Android SSO</b> nor <b>Android Native Deep Linking</b> so please 
leave them disabled. This also means that the <b>Android Package Name</b> and <b>Android Class Name</b> are not relevant since they are only 
required fields for native linking, so they can be left blank too.
<br>
<br>

Finally there is a section where you are required to enter the Android Keystore <b>Hash</b>. As this is difficult to get, there is an option within the <b>Android  Preferences Tab</b> 
marked <b>Key Hash</b>. Pressing the button marked "Show key Hash" on that tab will generate a special security hash directly linked to your Keystore file which is what Facebook requires, so 
you should generate one and then copy/paste it into the Facebook Developers page.
<br>

The image below shows how your final Facebook Android section should look:

<h2>Note for iOS Apps</h2>

The basic setup for iOS apps with the Facebook functions is the same as for Android, however there are a few key things that need to be correctly set up on the actual Facebook Developers page for your app:
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Bundle ID</b>: Must match with the bundle ID of your game (usually of the form "com.{yourcompany}.{yourgame}").
		<li><b>iPhone App Store ID</b>: This is the Apple ID associated with your game as found on iTunes Connect for the iPhone game.
		<li><b>iPad App Store ID</b>: As above except for iPad.
		<li><b>Facebook Login</b>: <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> supports <b>Single Sign-On</b> for iOS apps, so you can enable this to allow the game to be launched from the iOS Facebook app.
		<li><b>Deep Linking</b>: This is not supported, so keep disabled.
		<li><b>URL Scheme Suffix</b>: This is not supported, so leave blank.
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Note for HTML5 Apps</h2>

The HTML5 target works almost exactly the same as the other target modules, however <i>you cannot test the functions locally</i>, meaning that you will have to compile and upload to your server to test. 
There is also one additional function that has been added to create offerwall compatability for HTML5 games that is not available for other platforms:<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><tt>facebook_launch_offerwall</tt>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

Please see the manual for further details, as it is not covered in this tutorial.
