<h2>The Game Idea</h2>

It is important that we first write a brief description of the game we are going to make, and because this is going to be our first game we better design something simple. It should keep the player interested for just a 
short time, so our game is going to be a little action game that we will name "<b>Catch the Clown</b>". Here is our description of the game:
<br>
<br>

<i><b>Catch the Clown</b><br>
"Catch the Clown" is a little action game. In this game a clown moves around in a playing field. The goal of the player is to catch the clown by clicking with the mouse on him. If the player progresses through the game 
the clown starts moving faster and it becomes more difficult to catch him. For each catch the score is raised and the goal is to get the highest possible score. Expected playing time is just a few minutes.</i>
<br>
<br>

Clearly, a game like this will have limited appeal, but we have to start simple and later we can add some features to the game to make it more interesting.
<br>
<br>

The second step in creating a game is to write a more precise design document, and you are recommended to always do this before making your game, even if it is very simple rough draft or outline of your plans. Here is our 
design document for "Catch the Clown":

<ul>
	<li><b>Game objects</b> - There will be just two game objects: the clown and the wall. The wall object has a square like image. The wall surrounding the playing area is made out of these objects. The wall object does nothing. 
	It just sits there to stop the clown from moving out of the area. The clown object has the image of a clown face. It moves with a fixed speed. Whenever it hits a wall object it bounces. When the player clicks on the clown with the 
	mouse the score is raised with 10 points. The clown jumps to a random place and the speed is increased with a small amount.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li><b>Sounds</b> - We will use two sounds in this game. A bounce sound that is used when the clown hits a wall, and a click sound that is used when the player manages to click with the mouse on the clown.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li><b>Controls</b> - The only control the player has is the mouse. Clicking with the left mouse button on the clown will catch it.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li><b>Game Play</b> - At the start of the game the score is set to 0. The room with the moving clown is shown. The game immediately begins. When the player presses the <Esc> key the game ends.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li><b>Levels</b> - There is just one level. The difficulty of the game increases because the speed of the clown increases after each successful catch.
</ul>

That should be good enough for the moment, and we can now start creating the game!
