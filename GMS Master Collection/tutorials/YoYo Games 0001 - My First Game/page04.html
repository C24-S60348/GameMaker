<h2>Adding Sounds</h2>

Now that we created the sprites we will need to create two sound effects. One must play when the clown hits a wall and the other must play when the clown is successfully caught with the mouse. We will use two wave 
files for this as wave files are excellent for short sound effects.
<br>
<br>

To create two sound resources:

<ol>
	<li>From the Resources menu, choose Create Sound. The Sound Properties form appears. Click on the Name field and rename it to "snd_bounce".
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Click on the <b>Load Sound</b> button, navigate to the <i>Game Assets</i> folder that came with the tutorial, and select the sound file <tt>bounce.wav</tt>. The form should now look like this:
		<br>
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="4_1.png">
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Press the OK button to close the form.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Create another sound resource and name it "snd_click".
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Click the <b>Load Sound</b> button and select the sound file <tt>click.wav</tt>.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Close the form.
</ol>

Within the sound properties form you can use the play button, with the green triangle pointing to the right, to listen to the sound which is repeated constantly unless you press the red stop button. Again, notice that the two 
sounds are shown in the resource tree on the left of the main <i>Gamemaker</i> window.
