<h2>The Mouse Event</h2>

Finally we need to define what to do when the user clicks with the left mouse on the clown. We are going to add four actions here...
<br>
<br>

First we will add 10 points to the score. This is easy as Game Maker automatically keeps and displays a score for you. Next we will play the click sound. Then, after this, we will jump the clown to a random position, 
and we will set a new random direction of motion with a slightly increased speed. The last two actions are added to gradually increase the difficulty of the game.
<br>
<br>

The following steps explain how to create the mouse event that we require:

<ol>
	<li>Press the <b>Add Event</b> button. In the Event Selector click on the <b>Mouse Event</b> and in the sub-menu that appears select <b>Left Pressed</b>. This event happens when the user presses the left mouse 
	button while the mouse cursor is on top of the instance and will only be triggered <i>once</i> for each press.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>From the tab labeled <b>Score</b> include the Set Score action.
		<br>

		<br>	
	<li>As new score indicate a value of 10 and also click on the box next to the property <b>Relative</b> to enable it. When <b>Relative</b> is enabled the value is added to the current score, otherwise the score would be 
	replaced by the value.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>From the tab <b>Main1</b> include a <b>Play Sound</b>action and for the sound indicate "snd_click". Leave Loop as false.
		<br>

		<br>
	<li>From the <b>Move</b> tab, include a <b>Jump to Random</b> action, which places the instance in a random, collision-free position. The parameters can be left unchanged for this action.
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="9_2.png">
		<br>
	<li>Finally we include a Move Fixed action.
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="7_2.png">
		<br>
	<li>Again select all eight arrows (and not the center square) and for the speed indicate a value of 0.5 and enable the <b>Relative</b> property to <i>add</i> 0.5 to the current speed.
</ol>

That is all the actions we need for the <b>Mouse Event</b> and the finished event list should look like this:

We are now finished with the clown object. We have included actions for the three events that are important, so press the OK button to close the form.
