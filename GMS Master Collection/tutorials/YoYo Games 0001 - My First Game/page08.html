<h2>The Collision Event</h2>

The next event we will define is a collision event with the wall object. Here we will bounce the clown against the wall and we will play the bounce sound effect.
<br>
<br>

To do this, follow these steps:

<ol>
	<li>Press the <b>Add Event</b> button. In the Event Selector click on the <b>Collision Event</b> button and select "obj_wall". The collision event is now added to the list of events.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Include a Bounce action by dragging it from the page at the right (from the "Move" tab, "Jump" section).
		<br>

		<br>
	<li>Leave the default values for this action. We are not interested in precise bounces and we want to bounce against solid objects.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Press OK to close the action form.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Select the the tab <b>"Main1"</b>, and from it include the <b>Play Sound</b> action.
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="8_2.png">
		<br>
	<li>Drag the <b>Play Sound</b> action below the <b>Bounce</b> action already present. In the action from, click on the icon to the right of the Sound property and from the list select "snd_bounce". Leave the 
	<b>Loop</b> property as false as we want to play the sound only once.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Press OK to close the action.
</ol>

That concludes the collision event with the wall object, which now has two actions to be performed (in the given order) when the collision occurs. If you have made a mistake, you can right-click with the mouse on an action you 
added and, for example, choose <b>Delete</b> to remove the action (or press the &lt;Delete&gt; key on the keyboard). You can also choose <b>Edit Values</b> to change the properties of the action (Double-clicking on the 
action will do the same), and you can drag them up and down to change the order in which they are executed within the event.
