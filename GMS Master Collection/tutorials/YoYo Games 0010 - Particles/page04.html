<h2>Creating Particles With D'n'D (I)</h2>

The built in effects are all fine and well for simple graphics, but they are a bit bland and can only use one color at a time. They also offer no precise control over the size or the alpha of the particles being created and, 
since they are included as standard with <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> they are far from original! Thankfully we can do better than them using the Drag'n'Drop actions for particles that can be found on the <b>Extras 
tab</b> of the object interface.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

So, create a new object and call it "<b>obj_DnD_Firework</b>". This will be our new custom firework effect, and we are going to make a catherine wheel type firework to compliment our previous built in particle 
rocket effect.
<br>
<br>

Add a <i>Create Event</i> and then drag a code block and add the following code:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

This will prevent the object from moving and set the necessary control alarms too. Now we need to add create our <b>particle system</b>, which is basically a "container" that is created by you and into which 
you can place particles and emitters to be used at any time.
<br>
<br>

<i>Note that you <b>cannot</b> create any particles other than the built in particle effects without having first defined a system in which to create them!</i>
<br>
<br>

To do this, go to the <b>Extras Tab</b> and drag the <i>Create Particle System</i> icon into the actions list and set it's depth to 0 (particle systems can have depth too, just like objects and tiles). We are now 
goingto create our first particle which will be a smoke effect which will rise up off of the main effect just like a real firework.
<br>
<br>

For any new particle you must start by defining it's properties, and that means deciding which particle we are going to use. The D'n'D interface offers you a choice of up to 16 different particles that can all be 
customised to suit your needs. Drag the <i>Create Particle</i> icon into the actions window and fill out it's properties as shown below:
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="img11.png"></img>
<br>
<br>

For "type" we should choose "type 0" as this is our first particle and we should give it a cloud shape from the predefined shape list with no sprite (we could use a custom sprite, but for this it's not needed).
<br>
<br>

Size is given as a range of values, and this is a standard mechanism when creating particles in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. You see, particles are created by the system based on a <i>general</i> set of rules, 
but each particle can be slightly different depending on how the range for different properties is set. For example, this particle has a size range from 5% of it's base scale (0.05) up to 20% of it's base scale, so 
all particles will be created within that range of sizes to start with. Should you need a specific size then you should set <i>both</i> the min and max values to be the same.
<br>
<br>

You will notice too that the "incr" option is set to 0.02. This value controls the size <i>increment</i> each step, and setting it to a positive value will add that percentage scale to the particle each step, in this 
case it's a 2% increase every step. We can set this to 0 for no size change, or even to a negative number to get a particle that reduces in size every step.
<br>
<br>

With the basic properties set, it's time now to set the color for the particle, so drag a <i>Particle Color</i> icon onto the action list and fill it out as shown:
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="img12.png"></img>
<br>
<br>
 
As before choose "type 0" as the particle we are working with, then set the color mix to "changing". In this way we will have a nice blend of color over each particle lifetime from the first color to the second 
rather than a general mix of colors being chosen for each particle. The colors themselves should be a light gray and a dark gray as this <i>is</i> a smoke particle after all, and you should set the start alpha to 
1 and the end alpha to 0, so that the individual particles will fade out over time.
<br>
<br>

Talking of time, we must also give our particles a lifetime in which to exist, and, as before with size, this can be defined as a range meaning that each infividual particle will have a different lifetime than all 
the others, with none being above or below the given range. To set this drag the <i>Particle Life</i> icon into the action list and use the following settings:
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="img13.png"></img>
<br>
<br>

Lifetime for a particle is calculated in steps, so the above particle will "live" a minimum of 5 steps and a maximum of 30 steps.
<br>
<br>

The final thing we should do to this particle is give it some movement, since smoke does rise after all! We can do this by setting the <i>Particle Gravity</i> as shown here:
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="img14.png"></img>
<br>
<br>

Just like instances, particles can have their own gravity force and direction, which will only act on the type of particle specified.
<br>
<br>

Now we have done the smoke, save the game and then pass onto the next section where we will define the firework effect itself.
