<h2>Physics in GameMaker</h2>

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce the experienced user to how the physics system in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> is set up. As such, it does not cover all aspects 
of what is possible using physics, but rather introduces you to some of the core concepts so that you can then experiment and create things afterwards with a firm 
understanding of the basics.
<br>
<br>

The game we are going to make, is a physics based version of "Asteroids", with a player ship, bullets, a bomb and (of course) asteroid objects, and each will have it's
own physics which will help to create a fun and challenging game!
<br>
<br>

Before we get started, it is worth noting that the physics system in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> is completely separate from the tradition movement and collision 
system that you may be used to. The moment that you tell <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> that you will be using physics in your rooms, all interactions between objects 
will be done through the physics system and previously available "built in" variables like <tt>speed</tt> and <tt>image_angle</tt> are no longer used as they were 
before, instead there are a whole new set of physical world variables and constants that we will need to use.
<br>
<br>

The game will use some special resources created for this purpose. To find them on your computer, please go to the top of the <i>GameMaker</i> screen and select the <b>Help</b> 
drop-down menu. You will see an option marked <b>Open Project</b> in explorer. If you select that then the standard file explorer will open showing the contents of you 
<i>GameMaker</i> project directory, all resources are stored here.
