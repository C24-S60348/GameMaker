<h2>Adding Bombs</h2>

Although the game can already be fun to play, there is something missing. You cannot lose! 
You can just keep clicking randomly, which is not really much fun. Hence, we are going to add
bombs to the game. If you click on a bomb you will lose and the game will end. Bombs will be static.
They won't move, but their number keeps increasing to make the game more and more difficult over time.
<br>
<br>

The bomb sprite is already present but we still need a sound effect for it. Press the button with the
speaker to add a sound. Give is an appropriate name, press the <b>Load Sound</b> button and select
<tt>explosion.wav</tt>. Press <b>OK</b> to close the sound form.
<br>
<br>

Now create the bomb object by clicking on the
green ball button. Give the object an appropriate name and the bomb sprite. We want the bomb to
appear in a random place. To this end, add the <b>Create</b> event. In it place the action to jump
to a random location.
<br>
<br>

When the user clicks on it we want the game to end. So add the <b>Mouse</b> event <b>Left pressed</b>.
As a first action we want to play the explode sound so add the play sound action (from the <b>main1</b> tab)
and select the explode sound. Next we want to reset the score to 0, so goto the <tt>Control</tt>tab and select 
the <tt>Set Variable</tt> action and write "score" for the variable and "0" for the value, then drag the <tt>Restart 
Room</tt> icon from the <tt>main1</tt> tab. This will restart the room when the player clicks a bomb.
<br>
<br>

Save the game and give it a test to see if everything works as it should.
