<h2>Adding A Background</h2>

Assuming your game did work as expected, we are now going to make it look a bit fancier. 
First we will add a wooden background image. Click on the 
<b>Resources</b> menu and press <b>Create Background</b> 
or click on the button with the image: 
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="01_backgroundadd.png"></center>
<br>

In the form that appears, give the background an appropriate name and press the <b>Load Background</b> 
button. 
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="01_backgroundload.png"></center>
<br>

In the file selector that appears go to the same folder as previously mentioned for the sprites (<b>Your Project</b> then <b>Assets</b>) and in there find the image marked <tt>wood.gif</tt> and double click on it.
<br>
<br>

Press <b>OK</b> to close the form. The background should now be visible in the list at the left. The next 
step is to make the background visible in the room we already created. To reopen the form for the room, double 
click on it in the list at the left. (Don't add a new room!). In the form, click on the tab <b>backgrounds</b>  
to open that page. 
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="01_roomback1.png"></center>
<br>

In the middle click on the menu icon, next to where it says &lt;no background&gt; and select the wooden background. 
The background should now be visible in the room at the right. 
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="01_roomback2.png"></center>
<br>

(Note that there are many options you can set about backgrounds in rooms but we don't need them here. 
You can find more information about this in the help file.) Press the green check-mark at the top left 
to close the room form. Now better save the game and run it to see whether the background is shown 
correctly.
