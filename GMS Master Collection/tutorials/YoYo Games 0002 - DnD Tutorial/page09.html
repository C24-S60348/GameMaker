<h2>Adding A Sound</h2>

Next we add a sound effect to the game. This effect must
play when the player clicks on an apple. Click on the 
<b>Resources</b> menu and press <b>Create Sound</b>
or click on the button with the image of a speaker:

<br>

In the form that appears, give the sound an appropriate name and press the <b>Load Sound</b>
button. 
<br>
<br>

<br>

In the file selector that appears open the folder where the resources are (the same as where you found the sprites and backgrounds) 
and in there double click on the sound file <tt>click.wav</tt>.
<br>
<br>

Press <b>OK</b> to close the form. The sound should now be visible in the list at the left. We now need to 
make sure the sound is played when the player clicks on an apple. Reopen the apple object by double clicking 
on it in the list at the left.
<br>
<br>

Select the <b>Left Pressed</b> event, by clicking on it in the list of events. In the list 
of actions you will now see the jump and score actions. At the right of the form, select the tabbed page labeled 
<b>main1</b>. A new set of actions appears. Drag the action with the speaker on it to the list of actions to play 
a sound.
<br>

<br>

In the form that appears, select as a sound the click sound (click with 
the mouse on the top menu icon to select the sound). Make 
sure to keep the value of <b>loop</b> to false as we want the sound to play only once. Next press the <b>OK</b> 
button. The action list should now look as follows:
<br>
<br>

<br>

Again press <b>OK</b> to close the object form. Save and play the game, and now the sound should 
play whenever you click on an apple.
