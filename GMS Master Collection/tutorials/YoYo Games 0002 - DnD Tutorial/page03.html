<h2>Creating Objects</h2>

Sprites are just images. They don't do anything. But objects in your game must 
perform actions. They must move around, react to mouse clicks, etc. So the next 
step is create some objects. We will start with the wall object. 
To add an object click on the <b>Resources</b> menu and press <b>Create Object</b> 
or click on the button with the green ball.

The form that appears might look a bit 
complicated but don't worry. It will soon become clear.
<br>
<br>

We first give the object an appropriate name <tt>obj_wall</tt>. Next, 
to give it the appropriate sprite, click on the menu icon to the right of <tt>&lt;no sprite&gt;</tt> 
and from the menu that appears select the wall sprite:

<br>


The wall object must be solid cause we do not want the fruit to move through it. To this end, 
press the checkbox <b>Solid</b> to select it. As the wall needs no further behavior, press the <b>OK</b> 
button to close the form. The wall object should now have appeared in the list at the left. Better 
save your work before continuing.
