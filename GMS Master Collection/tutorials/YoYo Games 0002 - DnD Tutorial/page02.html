<h2>Adding Sprites</h2>

Our game needs images for the walls, the fruits, and the bomb. Such images are called <b>sprites</b> in <i>GameMaker</i>. So the first step is to add some sprites. To do so, we will use some sprites that have been 
prepared especially for this tutorial.
<br>
<br>

To add a sprite click on the <b>Resources</b> menu and press <b>Create Sprite</b> or click on the button with the Pacman symbol:
<br>
<br>

<br>

A rather empty form will appear. In this form, press the button <b>Load Sprite</b>.
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="01_spriteload.png">
<br>

In the file selector that appears you must browse to the <b>Project</b> folder, then select <b>Assets</b>, this may be the default location already. Once there browse the available 
resources and double click on the image <tt>wall.png</tt>.
<br>
<br>

The sprite form should now show the wall block image. You might want to give the sprite an appropriate name, e.g. <tt>spr_wall</tt>.
<br>
<br>

<img class="center"  src="01_spritename.png">
<br>

Now press the <b>OK</b> button to close the form. At the left of the <i>GameMaker</i> window you should now see the sprite you just added. In 
the same way add sprites for the apple, banana, bomb, cherry, and strawberry and give them appropriate names. The list at the left of the window should now look as follows:
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="01_spritelist.png">
<br>

Before continuing you might want to save your work. Click on the <b>File</b> menu, press <b>Save</b>, and select an appropriate location and file name. 
Note that the file will get the extension <tt>.gmk</tt>. All files created with <i>GameMaker</i> will have that extension.  
<br>
