In the game we create, some pieces of fruit move around. The player 
must click on the fruits with the mouse to collect them. For each collected fruit, points 
are scored. Fast moving fruits give more points than slow fruits. And there are

The game will use some special resources created for this purpose. To find them on your computer, please go to the top of the <i>GameMaker</i> screen and select the <b>Help</b> 
drop-down menu. You will see an option marked <b>Open Project</b> in explorer. If you select that then the standard file explorer will open showing the contents of you 
<i>GameMaker</i> project directory, and there you can browse to "Assets". All resources are stored here. In the process of this tutorial you will 
be reminded of this location.
