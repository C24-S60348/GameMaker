<h2>Adding Music</h2>

To improve the atmosphere we are going to add background music to the game. Click again on the button 
to add a sound. In the form give the sound an appropriate name and press the <b>Load Sound</b> button. 
You should still be in the folder with the sounds for the tutorial. Select the file <tt>music.mp3</tt>. This is an mp3 file, 
which are useful as background music as they are rather small, and many can be found for free on the internet. 
Press <b>OK</b> to close the sound form.
<br>
<br>

Now we need to make sure that the sound will play at the beginning of the game and loop forever. We are 
going to use an additional object for it. Press the button with the green ball to add a new object and 
give it an appropriate name. It does not need a sprite. Click on the <b>Add Event</b> button and select the 
<b>Create</b> event. At the right side select the page <b>main1</b> and drag the <b>Play Sound</b> action 
into the action list. (You should by now know how this works.) As a sound select the music and set <b>loop</b> 
to true. So the music will now play forever after the object is created.

Press <b>OK</b> to close the action form and again press <b>OK</b> to close the object form. We still need 
to add the object to the room, otherwise it won't be created. In the list at the left double click on the room to 
open its form. Make sure the <b>objects</b> page is visible at the left. 
Click on the menu icon in the middle to select the music object. Now click somewhere in the room to add an instance 
of the object. The object has no sprite so a little blue ball with a question mark is shown instead:

Be careful to only add one instance of the music object. Press the green checkbox 
to close the room form. Save the game and run it. You should now hear background music.
