<h2>Testing The Game</h2>

Now it is time to test the game. Better save the game first. Click on the <b>Run</b> menu and press 
<b>Run normally</b> or press the green run button in the tool-bar.

If you followed the previous steps correctly the <i>GameMaker</i> window disappears and 
a window shows in which the apples move around. If they 
hit the wall they should bounce back. And if you manage to click with your mouse on one of the apples, 
it will jump somewhere else.

Better check the game carefully. Do the apples move in different directions? If not you probably did not 
create the correct <b>Create</b> event. Do they bounce of the walls? If not, you probably either did not 
make the walls solid or you did not create the correct <b>Collision</b> event. Can you click on them with 
the mouse? If not you must have made an error in the <b>Mouse press</b> 
event.

You can switch the game to fullscreen mode by pressing ALT+ENTER. Press Esc to end the game.
