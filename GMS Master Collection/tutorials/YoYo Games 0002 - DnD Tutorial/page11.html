<h2>More Fruit</h2>

Let us now add some variation to the game by including other types of fruit. Because the steps are 
the same as before we only describe the global details. The sprites for the fruits are 
already there so we don't need to add them anymore. 
<br>
<br>

Add a new object (click the green ball). Give it an appropriate name and give it the banana sprite. This 
one is going to be a bit more difficult to click on. Add the <b>Create</b> event and in it add the action to 
move in a fixed direction. Only select the diagonal arrows and give it a speed of 12. 
<br>
<br>

Add a <b>Collision</b> event with the wall object and it in add the action to bounce, just as before. Next add the 
<b>Mouse</b> event for <b>Left pressed</b>. In it add the action to let the object jump to a random position. 
Add the action to set the score (from the <b>score</b> tab) with a value of 100 (this is a more difficult fruit 
so you should get a higher score), and don't forget to click the <b>Relative</b> box to add the value to the score. 
Finally add the action to play a sound (from the <b>main1</b> tab) and play the click sound. 
<br>
<br>

In the same way add an object for the cherry and for the strawberry. You can give them different speeds and corresponding 
higher or lower scores. If you find this all a lot of work, you can also right-click on an existing object and select 
<b>Duplicate</b>. This creates a copy of the object. You can now change the name and sprite, and 
change the values for the different actions (by double clicking on them).

Now reopen the room (double click on it in the list) and add a few instances of the different fruits. You might need to remove some apples to 
make room. Remember that you can use the right mouse button to remove instances. 
<br>
<br>

Save and play the game. Test it all carefully.
