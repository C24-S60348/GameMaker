<h2>Congratulations!</h2>

You have now finished your DnD game. As you saw, it was not very difficult, and your game should look something like this:
<br>

<br>

If it did not really work correctly, you can always load the game from the <tt>Examples</tt> folder. Once the game 
is ready you might want to give it to your friends. But they might not have <i>GameMaker</i>. To this end 
go to the <b>File</b> menu and click on <b>Create Executable</b>. Indicate the name (and location) 
and press <b>Save</b>. You will now have a stand-alone game that you can give to everybody to play.
<br>
<br>

You have learned about the most important elements of <i>GameMaker</i>: sprites, backgrounds, sounds, music, 
objects, events, actions, and rooms. You should now be able to start making your own games. But there is a 
lot more to learn. You can check the help file or you can read some more tutorials. And there even are 
books about <i>GameMaker</i>. You can access all this information through the <b>Help</b> menu. Enjoy!
